# Untitled Elm Wordle Clone

A clone of [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/). My motivation was a simple project to learn Elm.

## Development prerequisites

Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com). Add plugins for [elm](https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-elm) and [nodejd](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs). Will use versions in `.tool-versions`.
